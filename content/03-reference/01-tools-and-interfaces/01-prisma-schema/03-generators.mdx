<TopBlock>

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command, including:

* The **client language** (currently only `prisma-client-js` is available)
* Target **engine binaries** (for example, `debian-openssl-1.0.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 14.04, or `native` if you are working locally)

Each Prisma schema has one generator, represented by the [`generator`](prisma-schema-reference#inlinecodegeneratorinlinecode) <span class="api"></span> block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["linux-msl"]
}
```

</TopBlock>

## Binary targets

Prisma uses several [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). For example:

* Prisma Client uses the [query engine binary file](../prisma-client/query-engine) under the hood to communicate with a database. 
* Prisma Migrate uses the migration engine binary file to run schema migrations against a database.

These _engines_ are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable _binary files_.

Being aware of the binary file is especially important when [deploying](../prisma-client/deployment) your application to production!
